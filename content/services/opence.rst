The Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) and Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB) partner with IBM and OpenPOWER in order to provide a download resources around Open-CE. Open-CE is a community driven software distribution for machine learning that runs on standard Linux platforms with NVIDIA GPU technologies.

Open-CE Release 1.2.0
---------------------

*Release date: 04/16/2021*

**What's new**

This is release 1.2 of Open Cognitive Environment (Open-CE), code named Prairiedog.

Previously, the Open-CE build tools were part of the `Open-CE repository`_. `They can now be found in their own repo`_.

A release of Open-CE now only includes:
- The Open-CE env files used to generate a conda channel containing all of the packages that are part of an Open-CE release.
- A collection of feedstocks containing conda recipes for building the packages that are part of an Open-CE release.

**New Features**
- PyArrow is now included as part of Open-CE.
- The protobuf version that all Open-CE packages use is now set to 3.11.2.
- TensorFlow serving was removed, due to its incompatibility with protobuf 3.11.2

**Bug Fix Changes**
- The conda hash string has been removed from the name of all noarch packages.
- The version of sqlite that TensorFlow uses is now explicitly set 38 39.

- Open-CE is distributed as prebuilt containers, or on demand through the Conda provisioning process.

  - All of the Conda packages are available in a `Open-CE Conda channel`_
  - Conda packages are available in the `Open-CE 1.2.0 Conda channel`_
  - There is no install package to download, instead connect to the Conda channel and install your packages from there
  - Package dependencies are automatically resolved
  - Delivery of packages is open and continuous
  - Enable Python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
  - You can run more than one framework at the same time in the same environment. For example, you can run TensorFlow and PyTorch at the same time.

- IBM Power System IC922 with NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs
- IBM Power System AC922 with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs
- IBM Power System S822LC with NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs
- x86_64 systems with NVIDIA Tesla V100 or P100 GPUs

- Supported operating systems:

  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux for POWER LE 7.8, 8.x
  - Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS) 7.8, 8.x
  - Ubuntu 20.04.1

- Required 3rd party software:

  - NVIDIA GPU driver 440.33 - 460.32
  - CUDA driver 10.2 or 11.0

Installing the Open-CE Repository and Frameworks
------------------------------------------------

.. _Setting up the software repository:

Setting up the software repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Open-CE MLDL packages are distributed as conda packages in an online conda repository. Conda must be configured to give priority to installing packages from this channel.

Add the Open-CE channel to the conda configuration by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda config --prepend channels https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/open-ce/current/

.. _Creating conda environments:

Creating conda environments (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With conda, you can create environments that have different versions of Python or packages installed in them. Conda environments are optional but recommended. If not used, packages are installed in the default environment called base, which often has a higher risk of containing conflicting packages or dependencies. Switching between environments is called activating the environment.

The syntax to create and activate a conda environment is:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create --name <environment name> python=<python version> conda activate <environment name>

Note: It is recommended that you specify the Python version when creating a new environment. If you do not specify the version, Python 3.7 is installed when any package that requires Python are installed.

The only valid Python versions with Open-CE are Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

For example, to create an environment named opence_env with Python 3.6:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create --name opence_env python=3.6 conda activate opence_env

For more information on what you can do with conda environment see https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html.

Note: Open-CE should be run as a non-privileged user and not root. The Open-CE components are designed to be usable by normal users, and the pre-installed docker images provide a non-root user by default. Some of the Open-CE components will give warnings or will fail when run as root.


.. _Installing the MLDL frameworks:

Installing frameworks individually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install the MLDL frameworks individually. The framework packages include the following versions.

With the conda environment activated, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install <package name>

.. _Uninstalling the MLDL frameworks:

Uninstalling the Open-CE MLDL frameworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find information about uninstalling machine learning and deep learning MLDL frameworks.

The MLDL framework packages can be uninstalled individually, or you can uninstall all of the MLDL packages at the same time.

If the frameworks are installed into a separate conda environment, all of the frameworks can be removed by simply deleting the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda env remove -n <environment name>

Individual frameworks (and any packages that depend on them) can be removed by removing the individual package:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda remove <package name>

Important: This command removes the specified packages and any packages that depend on any of the specified packages. If you want to skip this dependency checking and remove just the requested packages, add the --force option. However, this may break your environment, so use this option with caution.


Previous releases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend that you install the most current release of Open-CE, however, if you have an earlier version installed, you can find information below:
