than 160 high-profile open source projects since joining the lab as lead systems administrator and architect in 2007.
Lanceâ€™s involvement in the open source community began in 2003, when he became a developer and package maintainer with
`Gentoo Linux`_. Prior to joining the OSL, Lance was a UNIX Administrator for the Enterprise Server Technologies group
at `Kansas State University`_. In his free time he helps organize `Beaver BarCamp`_, and enjoys playing the trumpet and

  **Faculty Research Assistant - Computational Scientist**

Max joined the OSL in early 2022, and is split half time between OSL and the `Center for Quantitative Life Sciences (CQLS)`_. He received his 
degree in Computer Systems from OSU EECS in 2019, and spent two years at the `Clackamas Education Service District`_ assisting school 
districts across Clackamas County with enterprise level computing and infrastructure, before returning to OSU. Max's hybrid position with the OSL and 
CQLS primarily focuses on delivering the services of a new community platform: the OpenPower Hub. In his free time Max spends it with 
family and friends, in his home lab tinkering on some sort of computer or electronics, backpacking, skiing, seeking the perfect IPA, or 
playing video games of a complex fashion.

   **Student Systems Engineer**

Ethan joined the OSL in June of 2020 studying Computer Science. He is enthusiastic about all the opportunities
available to him here and is grateful for this chance to learn more about the OSS ecosystem. Ethan's first introduction
to OSS was when he installed Ubuntu on his desktop in middle school and has loved it ever since. His first programming
experience was in FIRST LEGO League robotics and continues to love elegant solutions to complex problems. If he isn't
working with technology, Ethan enjoys playing piano, reading, hiking and tinkering.

.. class:: no-breaks

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Violet joined the OSL in August 2021. She first heard of the OSL while doing routine maintenance on her Arch Linux
system by noticing it provides mirroring services for Arch,  and later discovered it again while looking for software
and computing groups on campus. She hopes that working at the OSL will help her to develop professional skills working
in the industry, in teams, and with clients, as well as help her round out her capabilities. In her free time, Violet
enjoys playing video games and analyzing the themes that can be expressed only through interactive media, producing
simple videos for YouTube, using mathematics for optimization and data analysis, and learning every little thing she
can.
