  **Director**

`Lance`_ became OSL director in early 2013. He has managed all of the hosting activities that the OSL provides for more
than 160 high-profile open source projects since joining the lab as lead systems administrator and architect in 2007.
Lanceâ€™s involvement in the open source community began in 2003, when he became a developer and package maintainer with
`Gentoo Linux`_. Prior to joining the OSL, Lance was a UNIX Administrator for the Enterprise Server Technologies group
at `Kansas State University`_. In his free time he helps organize `Beaver BarCamp`_, and enjoys playing the trumpet and
spending time with his family.

  **Faculty Research Assistant - Computational Scientist**

Max joined the OSL in early 2022, and is split half time between OSL and the `Center for Quantitative Life Sciences (CQLS)`_. He received his 
degree in Computer Systems from OSU EECS in 2019, and spent two years at the `Clackamas Education Service District`_ assisting school 
districts across Clackamas County with enterprise level computing and infrastructure, before returning to OSU. Max's hybrid position with the OSL and 
CQLS primarily focuses on delivering the services of a new community platform: the OpenPower Hub. In his free time Max spends it with 
family and friends, in his home lab tinkering on some sort of computer or electronics, backpacking, skiing, seeking the perfect IPA, or 
playing video games of a complex fashion.

   **Student Systems Engineer**

Ethan joined the OSL in June of 2020 studying Computer Science. He is enthusiastic about all the opportunities
available to him here and is grateful for this chance to learn more about the OSS ecosystem. Ethan's first introduction
to OSS was when he installed Ubuntu on his desktop in middle school and has loved it ever since. His first programming
experience was in FIRST LEGO League robotics and continues to love elegant solutions to complex problems. If he isn't
working with technology, Ethan enjoys playing piano, reading, hiking and tinkering.

.. class:: no-breaks

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Violet joined the OSL in August 2021. She first heard of the OSL while doing routine maintenance on her Arch Linux
system by noticing it provides mirroring services for Arch,  and later discovered it again while looking for software
and computing groups on campus. She hopes that working at the OSL will help her to develop professional skills working
in the industry, in teams, and with clients, as well as help her round out her capabilities. In her free time, Violet
enjoys playing video games and analyzing the themes that can be expressed only through interactive media, producing
simple videos for YouTube, using mathematics for optimization and data analysis, and learning every little thing she
can.

.. class:: no-breaks

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Paul joined the OSL in May 2021. He's been using OSL mirrors since arriving on
campus, and is glad for the opportunity to contribute to the FOSS ecosystem. He's
been using Linux since high school, and enjoys optimizing his work environment and
trying out new community projects.
Paul is a computer science major and is interested in cybersecurity,
infrastructure automation, and spending 3 hours writing scripts that save 1
minute. He spends the time that these scripts save hunting mushrooms, reading,
and rock climbing.

.. class:: no-breaks

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Starting in November of 2022, Zach was brought aboard during his Junior year of his college career as a Computer Science major. Zach's first introduction to programming dated back to the fifth grade, in 2013, where he did a presentation on "How to Create an Adder in Lua". His first experience with the Linux environment started in late-2019, when he used a Raspberry-Pi to set up a local file sharing server; and ever since then he's used some flavor of Linux as a daily driver for both personal and server use. Outside of the office and classroom, Zach enjoys modding games, with an added interest in level design. With now being employed at the Open Source Lab, he hopes to further understand the duties of a systems administrator while also providing assistance in service hosting for the FOSS community.

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Abi joined the OSL in November 2022. She first heard of OSL while looking through the OSU jobs website and was
instantly drawn to the Open Source environment that OSL supports and encourages. While she does not have any
previous experience in open source software, she hopes that OSL will prepare her for future open source projects 
and jumpstart her career in computer science. In her free time, Abi likes to play video games (namely Overwatch 
and Dead by Daylight), watch comedy TV shows, and expand her knowledge in computer science and cyber security.

.. class:: no-breaks

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Oria has been excited about open-source software from far too young an age, so no one should have told her there was an Open Source Lab right at OSU! In all seriousness, she started at the OSL in November 2022 as a way to further explore computer science and get involved in the open-source community. When not learning new ways to play on computers, she dabbles in digital drawing, board games, and animation.
